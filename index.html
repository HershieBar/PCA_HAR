        Introduction
    </h1>

    <p>
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that transforms a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly 
        uncorrelated variables called principal components.This technique is widely used in the reduction of high feature datasets, which then can be used for making predictive 
        models. It is particularly useful in processing data where multicollinearity may be a problem, or before machine learning applications to enhance performance and reduce
        computational costs. With this we will explore how to use and interpret the reduced dataset produced by PCA using the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone 
        dataeset.The HAR dataset contains time and frequency domain variables extracted from smartphone sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) while subjects performed 
        activities like walking, sitting, standing, etc. This dataset is often used for building models that can recognize human activities based on sensor data.

    <h1>
        Data Manipulation 
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        There were 2 features that were discarded/changed. The feature that was discarded was the volunteer number since there was no characteristics that was provided about 
        the person, so nothing can be concluded from the data about the motion under different personal characteristics such as height, weight, age, and other factors that can
        vary in an individuals movement, as these were not given. Further we are not intersted in individual variances of the above recorded activity and only want to see 
        patterns in the motion of said activities. The other feature that was changed was Activity, which was a qualitative measurement, which was converted into numerical 
        values (Standing = 1, Sitting = 2, etc) to code the data
    </p>

    <h1>
        PCA Methodology 
    </h1>

    <p>
        As mentioned before PCA is an algorithm that reduces the dimensionality (i.e Features) of a dataset. Our goal using this algorithm is to find the eigenvalues that result in the most 
        variance in the data and the resulting eigenvectors will be our *Principal Components*. To find these eigenvalues, we must first normalize the dataset to ensure each data point is 
        uniformly scaled as features that have high ranges of values will dominate over lower ranges of values, resulting in biased Principal Components. We then create a Covariance Matrix with 
        our centered data and find the eigenvalues of that matrix. After that, we determine the eigen-outliers and create our Principal Component graphs

    </div>

    <p>
        These are the resulting eigenvalues of our covariance matrix segmented into bins. Graphically we can see that there are 3 eigen-outliers in this graph, however, we do not know if all of these 
        values are truely signals to the data. To verify if these values are in fact are PCs, we will use the Marchenko-Pastur Distribution, which will produce asymtopical behavior
        that allows us to interpret which eigenvalues are our signals.

    </div>

    <h4>
        Marchenko-Pastur Distribution Analysis
    </h4>

    <p>
        Even though the Marchenko-Pastur Distribution does not fit nicely with the data, this tells us enough about which eigenvalues are noise and signals. First off we can 
        conclude that the eigen-outliers are 2.62990497, 2.89280617, 36.8986122, as they are outside the upper bound of the distribution meaning that these eigenvalues are our Prinicipal Components. 
        Anything under the distribution tells us that these eigenvalues noise and contribute little to no signal to the actual data. The eigenvalues below the lower bound of the Marcenko 
        Distribution have the are not included as being PC's because these values are very small, meaning that they have a weak signal-to-noise ratio, as there is some information associated with these 
        eigenvalues, however it is a small contribution to the overall variance/infomration to the dataset. And not including these eigenvalues would not significantly influnece our data reduction.

        <div class="boxes">
            <h2>PC 1</h2>
            <p>
                tGravityAcc-energy()-X: This feature has the highest positive loading and represents the energy of the gravity acceleration signal in the X-direction. The fact that this feature dominates 
                PC1 suggests that this component captures variations in the acceleration due to gravity, which is likely to differ across activities like standing, sitting, or lying down. <br><br>
                
                Activity: With a negative loading, the 'Activity' feature seems to be an identifier or numerical code that distinguishes between different activities. Its negative sign suggests that as the
                'Activity' variable increases, the 'tGravityAcc-energy()-X' tends to decrease, indicating an inverse relationship in the activity coding or intensity.<br><br>
                
                tGravityAcc-mean()-X: This represents the average gravity acceleration in the X-direction. Similar to the energy, this suggests that PC1 is heavily influenced by how the orientation of the
                device (and by extension, the user's body) changes with different activities.<br><br>
                
                angle(X,gravityMean): The angle between the X-axis and the gravity vector has a significant influence on PC1 with a negative loading, indicating that changes in this angle are important in
                differentiating between activities.<br><br>
                
                tGravityAcc-max()-X: The maximum value of gravity acceleration in the X-direction also contributes significantly to PC1. This further emphasizes the importance of static and transitional 
                aspects of the user's orientation relative to gravity in this component.<br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="boxes">
            <h2>PC 2</h2>
            <p> 
                Activity: This feature appears again with a positive loading, confirming its importance in discriminating between different activities across multiple components.<br><br>
        
                tBodyGyroMag-entropy(): The entropy of the gyroscope magnitude reflects the complexity or randomness of the gyroscope signal. A higher value could indicate more complex body motion,
                possibly associated with dynamic activities like walking or running.<br><br>
                
                fBodyAcc-kurtosis()-X: This measures the 'tailedness' of the frequency domain signal from body acceleration in the X-direction. It's interesting that PC2 relates to both frequency 
                (fBodyAcc) and time (tBodyGyro) domain features, suggesting a blend of dynamic movement and signal properties.<br><br>
                
                fBodyAcc-skewness()-Z: This represents the asymmetry of the body acceleration frequency distribution in the Z-direction. Skewness can indicate the directionality of movement, which 
                might differentiate activities such as walking upstairs vs downstairs.<br><br>
                
                tGravityAcc-energy()-X: The negative loading of gravity acceleration energy in the X-direction, which contrasts with its positive contribution in PC1, suggesting that PC2 may capture
                different aspects of motion or orientation changes.<br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="boxes">
            <h2>PC 3</h2>
            <p>
                Activity: Yet again, 'Activity' appears, which implies that even after accounting for orientation and entropy features, the type of activity remains a significant factor in the data's 
                variability.<br><br>
                
                fBodyAccJerk-entropy()-X and fBodyAccJerk-entropy()-Y: The entropy of body linear acceleration (jerk signals) in both X and Y directions suggests that PC3 may be capturing the irregularity
                and complexity of motion changes, as jerk signals are indicative of sudden movements which differ between activities.<br><br>
                
                tBodyAccJerkMag-entropy(): This is the entropy of the magnitude of body acceleration jerk, which further supports the notion that PC3 is capturing the nuances of transient, possibly 
                abrupt movements.<br><br>
                
                fBodyAcc-entropy()-X: This feature measures the randomness in the frequency domain of the body acceleration signal in the X-direction, implying that PC3 is sensitive to both sudden 
                movements and the structured patterns in the frequency domain. <br><br>
